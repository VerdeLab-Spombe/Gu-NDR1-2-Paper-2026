This repository contains code used in NDR1/2 kinases regulate cell polarization and cell motility through Cdc42 GTPase and Pard3 signaling in mammalian cells, written by Jun Gu, Jelena Marjanovic, Marjana Tomic-Canic, Fangliang Zhang, and Fulvia Verde. Additional information of this paper can be found in the methods section. For the Fig1 Cdc42 biosensor analysis, we first used the u-registration software from Danuser Lab software page from github. The code was run using Matlab Version R2024a.
